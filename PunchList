Need:

fill prescriptions method in pharmacist
     arguments (Prescription rx, Person p )
       update existing drugLines for patient if prescription is already in system - refills decrement and times refilled increment
     always check contraindications
     ??? check conditions?? - add pre-existing conditions or diagnosis to Patient?
checkContraindications method - needs to be independent of fill prescriptions in Pharmacist
     
findDoctors method - generate a list of doctors who prescribed a named drug more than a stipulated number of times - (from watchlist)

COMMIT METHOD: in driver to call each object to be updated after a prescription is filled:
     patient - add or update drugline
     doctor - update watchlist
     pharamcy activity - add outcome of transaction - simple!!
          when false - update pharmacy activity file with reason why not filled & note contraindication found
          when true - update pharmacy activity file with SUCCESS
